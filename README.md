Instructions on how to navigate

The Cashier system does as follows:
   - Outputs welcome message.
   - Asks the customer to enter a barcode ranging from "0120001" ... "0120010".
   - I'f the customer types in an incorrect value, they will be presented with an 
     error message and asked to re-enter a barcode. 
   - I'f the customer enters "f" or "F", the total cost of the products selected are calculated. 
   - The system will then ask the user to input a value for the amount needed to complete the transaction.
   - I'f the amount recieved is not enough to complete the transaction, the system will ask for more cash. Otherwise
     if the amount received is over the required payment, the system will total the amount of change needed to give
	 back to the customer. 
   - The system will then ask the customer if they would like a reciept. If yes, then the customer can type, 
     "y", "Y", "yes" or "Yes  otherwise if no ("n", "N", "no", "No") then it will skip to ask for a new customer. 
   - The same applies for when the system asks whether there is a new customer or not. If there is, the system prints out
     a christmas greeting, if there isn't, it'll print out the Christmas greeting for the last time. 
   - The system will then begin at the start of the program if  "y", "Y", "yes" or "Yes" is specified.
